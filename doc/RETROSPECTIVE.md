# Lab Retrospective Discussion
### Names

## Project's current progress
We are currently almost done with implementing the basic pacman game and then after that
we plan to extend our logic to the other game tpyes.

## Current level of communication
21

## Satisfaction with team roles
Everyone seems to be pulling their own weight :)

## Teamwork that worked well

* We have been having separate team meetings for the view and the backend. Then
we all meet up to combine what we worked on.

* Our in person meetings have been very helpful and we have been very supportive and honest
with each other.


## Teamwork that could be improved

* We could communicate more when we make new issues.

* We could share frontend details with the backend and vise versa.


## Teamwork to improve next Sprint
We can continue out in person meetings but cut down on our Zoom meetings (not very effective).
