##What was learned during this Sprint and the implementation plan for the next Sprint
* Show issue breakdown 
* A good event that occurred over this sprint was when we got collisions working. This enabled us to play a real pacman game
* A bad event that occurred is an issue with grid pane on Windows computers. The grid width is different for mac versus Windows
* We texted in our group chat for every merge. We also met in person multiple times a week.
* We are planning on finishing the other game variants as well as clean up the current pacman game. This will require us to add more data to the json file.
