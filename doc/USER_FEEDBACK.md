* It is hard to find the actual file to load in to start the game.
* Turns are really hard to make with pacman when trying to make a sharp turn (without first stopping
on a wall)
* ghost is not moving smooth
* pacman is clipping into the wall a little sometimes
* They did not know when they won the game.
* They did not know that they lost a life.
* The ghost was not reset after losing a life which could cause pacman to be spawn killed
* The ghosts are OP. We should implement a difficulty setting.
* The scoreboard is boring :(
