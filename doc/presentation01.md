#TEST DEMONSTRATION

##Elements to highlight:
 * Run from master and start on the home screen.
 * Talk about the current features in the home screen as well as the features that will be added soon.
 * Start the basic game (basics.json) and discuss the board generation.
 * Talk about the game control buttons.
 * Move the pacman around to show backend-frontend connectivity.
 * Discuss fucture plans for the game.
 * Discuss try catching in controller and plans to soon throw custom exceptions in the frontend
 * Walk through the basics.json file.
 * Show the GameScreen view tests.
 * Show Board tests and Game tests.


##What was learned during this Sprint and the implementation plan for the next Sprint
 * We reached all of our goals for this sprint except for creating the ghosts and making the dots interactable. We were very close to reaching our goal, but we were held back by unexpected issues that did not come up while planning. These issues primarily included technical details such as how the model should represent the game board (with a grid or just by using pixel locations) and design issues such as how we should organize all of the game pieces. These issues led us to have great team discussion that were very productive; however, they did slightly limit the amount of actual code that we wrote.
 * One positive event that occured during this issue was when we first successfully connected the frontend with the backend through the controller. This integration allowed the pacman to actually move around the board and was proof that our current code was functional. This positive event gave each team memeber confidence that we were on a good track.
 * One event that caused issues during this sprint was when we were deciding how the backend should store the current board data. Everyone seemed to have their own idea for the best possible design, and we spent a long time discussing the best way to move forward. We eventually reached an agreement as to what design to use and were able to continue coding. This event was honestly a good thing for the team overall. Not only did we improve the code's design, but we also all learned more about each other and are more comfortable debating ideas within the group.
 * One thing that works well for our team regarding communication is our in person team meetings. Everyone has an equal voice in these meetings and no one is afraid to share their ideas. One thing that did not work well communication wise was our communication between the frontend and the backend. The view people and the backend people were able to make a lot of progress by having a few private meetings; however, this led to a lot of code being written that the other end did not know much about. When it came time to integrate the frontend and the backend, there was a lot of confusion that wasted a lot of valuable time. For the next sprint, we plan on having taking the time during our full team meetings to update the other end (frontend or backend) on our recent activities.
 * For the next sprint, we first plan on finishing what we did not complete during the first sprint. This means finishing the ghosts and making the dots interactable. After we complete that, we plan on completing a fully operational basic pacman game. Having the ability to plan a fully operational basic pacman game with the correct file would mean that we are very well set up to implement the rest of the variations. We also plan on spending a large portion of time refactoring the code that we already have and cleaning up our current technical debt.
