###Sprint Plan

##Plan for our initial sprint

##Neil and Nick Conterno's API Responsiblities

Neil and Nick will focus on implementing launching the application display, the gridDisplay, and updating features of the view according to reactions from the Pacman (updating score after picking up energy dot, leaving from one side of screen and entering opposite, picking up powerups and changing how pacman is display). The goal in this first week is to account for changes that are triggered by the value obviously being updated using the controller. Changes in the view that will result from changes from the model will be implemented later because that requires a fully implemented grid in the back-end which will take time.

They will work together to implement the view features described above and communicate to divide up the work further and update each other regularly on what each person is working on and what needs to be done next.

##David Wu

David will work on the controller as well as designing the input files and producing a funcitoning processor. The first priority is producing files and creating a processor so that this can be connected with the back-end grid. He will also have to work closely with Neil and Nick on the view since it will rely on the controller.

##Nick Strauch and Abhinav Ratnagiri

Nick and Abhinav will work on implementing the back-end grid first. After implementing the backend grid they will implement the CreatureView, Pacman, and the Ghost. They will first prioritize their efforts on getting the movements working properly then adding in the other functionality.
